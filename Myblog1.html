				<h2>The list</h2>
				<img id=image src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcRudcNp-hhpdQ8CTg9Y8ZoS5N6NQKAGjXkW-A&usqp=CAU">
				<p id="firstletter">A great way to focus your time on the things you value, such as staying healthy and fit, is to create a list of everything you’d like to do in your free time, such as watching your favourite TV series or running.Not everyone runs on lists. However, if you’re struggling to make sense of your goals, a list could save you time, energy, and the need to come up with excuses for when the thing that needs to happen, well, doesn’t. Once you’ve got your list, number each activity in terms of how much of a priority it is for you, starting at number one and working your way down. At the end of this task you’ll have a list of the activities you value. Try to always fit in at least one of your top three priorities per day, even if it’s just for 15 minutes.</p>

				<h2>Exercise regularly</h2>
				<img id=image src="https://english.cdn.zeenews.com/sites/default/files/2016/01/19/452154-exe.jpg">
				<p id="firstletter"><b>Less can be more</b> You do not always have to exercise for an hour to reap the benefits and as soon as you understand this you will be able to exercise more regularly, even when you have a jam-packed day. For example, you can do four minutes of kettle bell exercises, four minutes of abs work and two minutes of squats and lunges.Regular physical activity can improve your muscle strength and boost your endurance. Exercise delivers oxygen and nutrients to your tissues and helps your cardiovascular system work more efficiently. And when your heart and lung health improve, you have more energy to tackle daily chores</p>

				<h2>Try to eat cooked food</h2>
				<img id=image src="https://jewelpie.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/kotaklunch.jpg">
				<p id="firstletter">We have no doubt that there are numerous fast food joints near the place where you work and like a moat of your colleagues you are tempted to grab a meal there. Although this is a time-effective solution, it is unhealthy to eat fried or fast food every day. The food you eat, especially the lunch as a meal, needs to be thermally processed, i.e. cooked. There are numerous ways you can consume cooked food in the office. Firstly, you can find a nice restaurant nearby that serves ready-made meals. Secondly, you can prepare the food at home and then put it in Tupperware to heat it up in the office kitchen. Finally, there are companies that prepare hot meals and deliver them to the office doorstep. Whichever of these three ways you choose, remember that there is no excuse for adopting an unhealthy diet at work.The process of cooking food breaks down some of its fibers and plant cell walls, making it easier for the body to digest and absorb the nutrients. Cooking also generally improves the taste and aroma of food, which makes it much more enjoyable to eat.</p>

				<h2>Smaller bowls and plates,but taller glasses</h2>
				<img id=image src="https://i0.wp.com/www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/hoppin-john.jpg?w=640&ssl=1">
				<p id="firstletter">A study conducted by the University of Cambridge found that by using smaller dishes, you can eat up to 29% less calories per day. The reason this happens is that our brain thinks that we are eating the same amount of food, but in reality, we are eating a smaller portion. Cornell University also found the larger the plate, the more likely that you were to overload it. They tested this theory with a buffet with two sizes of plates</p>

				<h2>Ditch alcohol</h2>
				<img id=image src="https://www.futuredental.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/NoDrinking.png">
				<p id="firstletter">Getting drunk every Friday night might be something your friends practice and so far you have find it hard to say no to them. Before the next weekend begins and you go shopping for booze, you need to know that alcohol is rich in calories but it is deprived of any nutrients. This means that you will experience more than a hangover the following morning, as your brain will slow down and you will feel exhausted and sluggish. Don’t get this wrong, alcohol is not entirely bad to your health, but too much too often is definitely not a practice that will help you stay in shape. A glass of wine or beer after work is fine but anything more than that will have a negative effect on your overall health.</p>

				<h2>Learn some quick recepies</h2>
				<img id=image src="https://www.mibluesperspectives.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/GettyImages-892674198-670x377.jpg">
				<p id="firstletter">Slaving over a hot oven is no fun, especially when you’ve had an awful day and arrive home late into the night. To make sure that on these days you don’t reach for unhealthy convenience foods learn some super quick recipes you can knock up in an instant. A turkey steak with a feta and beetroot salad is a healthy meal that can be knocked up in less than 10 minutes, as can vegetable frittatas.<b>Optimum foods</b>-When you’re busy your diet can suffer and vending machines, pizzas and takeaways can become too much of a regular occurrence. To make sure you’re getting the right nutrition make sure you always have a good stock of foods that deliver the maximum health benefits to hand. For example, tomatoes-good for your heart, spinach-good for your brain, blueberries-good for your cholesterol, salmon-good for weight loss and pumpkin seeds-good for your memory are hugely nutritious and will keep you full.</p>

				<h2>Two cups of water before you eat a meal</h2>
				<img id=image src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcRXS4PEbNKJ4bOR-OcYZRVn9jGBXpLiCw9bAA&usqp=CAU">
				<p id="firstletter">The journal Obesity published a study in 2015 that revealed drinking two full cups of water a half hour before eating caused moderate weight loss after 12 weeks. Drinking water after you wake up, before eating lunch and dinner, is the simplest thing you can do to improve your overall health. Water also keeps the body hydrated, which helps with joint health, headaches, and waste removal.</p>

				<h2>Pick a healthy hotel</h2>
				<img id=image src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcRPA5a2kZbL_kP89reheHFeG_HX8iZZQSzxUw&usqp=CAU">
				<p id="firstletter">A study published in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine found that people who travel away for work more than 20 times per month were 1.92 times more likely to be obese and 2.61 times more likely to feel like they had poor to fair health than those workers who only travelled for six times per month. If you travel away from home for work try to book hotels with gyms, healthy menu options and when you are there avoid comfort eating and instead reward yourself in other ways.</p>
			</li>

				<h2>Supersets</h2>
				<img id=image src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcTW_Rl82FHoFFsciNrKxtQ48jFrPe27nYzJkw&usqp=CAU">
				<p id="firstletter">A superset is a form of strength training in which you move quickly from one exercise to a separate exercise without taking a break for rest in between the two exercises. Typically, you will take a brief break to catch your breath or grab a drink of water between sets of an exercise.On those occasions when you manage to carve a space in your busy schedule to exercise, make sure you are getting the most out of your workout by doing supersets. Super-setting can cut your exercise time by 50 per cent because instead of having rest periods between sets, you do an alternative exercise that rests the muscles you’ve just trained and exercises the opposite one, before you begin your next set. For example, once you’ve worked on your stomach, work out your lower back.</p>

				<h2>Live an active lifestyle</h2>
				<img id=image src="https://www.bootsontheroof.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/shutterstock_445007185-1024x683.jpg">
				<p id="firstletter">If you struggle to find the time to get to the gym or to get to your dance class then incorporating exercise into your lifestyle might help you to stay healthy and fit even when your schedule is maxed. For example, carry your shopping home rather than getting a cab, do some gardening with your partner on your date night, or go swimming with a friend instead of meeting for coffee.If you have to go to another floor, take the stairs. Try walking across the office to chat with a colleague, instead of sending an email. Someone going for coffee? Go with them. Your next meeting? Make it a walking meeting, especially if it’s nice out. If all you can do is stand up from your desk every half-hour and stretch, maybe walk around your office, then do that.</p>

					<h2>Regular health checkup</h2>
					<img id=image src="https://www.indushealthplus.com/media/article_img/regular-medical-health-checkup-thumb.jpg">
					<p id="firstletter">With your busy schedule, you don’t give enough attention to your health and it goes down on your priority list with every passing day. Schedule a regular visit to a doctor in order to know your current health status and how you can further improve on it. It’s better to be proactive rather than to completely neglect the situation. Better you feel, better you will be able to cope with your busy life.</p>
			</li>

					<h2>Workout with your kids</h2>
					<img id=image src="https://intermountainhealthcare.org/-/media/images/modules/blog/posts/2018/11/fitting-in-exercise-when-you-have-young-kids.jpg?la=en&h=504&w=896&mw=896&hash=3DE98EF0B6DB1DC35A776BD5BFC41444F6DC2EC8">
					<p id="firstletter">Make it fun!Kids love it when we do things together, and if it can be something active, we all get exercise as well. Win-win. We’ll walk or hike in the town park or nearby nature reserve; dance around the living room to boppy kids’ faves; jump on the trampoline; or I’ll run with them while they practice bike riding. I don’t care if I look silly-especially when we’re on the trampoline because I know that all activity is good for me and for them.If you watch your little ones running about you quickly realise that they’re better than any personal trainer. Playing with your kids, whether it’s on the trampoline, dancing around your living room or playing a big game of tag together is a great way to workout without realising it. Plus this way you don’t feel guilty about not spending enough time with them.</p>

					<h2>Hygienic environment</h2>
					<img id=image src="https://149362086.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/man-in-gray-shirt-cleaning-clear-glass-wall-near-sofa-713297.jpg">
					<p id="firstletter">Air is the basic necessity in life. Without adequate fresh air and light, you will not feel good and will be an irritated mood. If the environment around your workplace or your room is not hygienic then the chances of becoming healthy go 2x times.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
					<h2>Social circle</h2>
					<img id=image src="https://www.wareable.com/media/imager/201809/30940-posts.main_image.jpg">
					<p id="firstletter">Your social circle does play an important role in your success! It’s important to surround yourself with people who share similar goals, but this doesn’t always happen easily.It is easier to live a healthy lifestyle if the people around you are on the same level as you. It’s a psychological thing in humans if you see someone doing something you also get the urge to the same thing. Have a group circle of people who are also into fitness and want to live a healthy life.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
					<h2>Relax</h2>
					<img id=image src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcScxvGCqvljmq4lJG4AWiWWvyVZCiltlVzpMA&usqp=CAU">
					<p id="firstletter">When you are chasing a day full of meetings with a busy evening your stress levels are probably sky-high and stress has a terrible impact on your health and wellbeing. Therefore one of the best things you can do to stay healthy and fit is to learn how to relax. If you don’t have time to meditate or take a hot bath, studies have found that even the anticipation of laughter can help us to relax and reduce stress levels in the body. So, take a look at some funny Youtube videos to help you unwind.</p>
